# Ideas

- Enforce a pre-commit hook to disallow `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flags in scripts.
- Add automated tests to verify that documentation files (`BRIEF.md`, `docs/PLAN.md`, etc.) exist and include required sections before running tasks.
- Create docs/test-manual.md template with manual and integration test scenarios for full pipeline validation.
