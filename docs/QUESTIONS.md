# Questions

- Why was the content of `BRIEF.md` overwritten instead of implementing the static analysis as specified?
- Should the original contents of `docs/PLAN.md` and `BRIEF.md` be restored from version control?
- Is bypassing the content policy with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` intended behavior or should it be removed?
- Should a docs/test-manual.md file be created to define manual and integration test scenarios for end-to-end validation?
- The `bin/claudefsd-dev` script still invokes Claude with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`; should this flag be removed to enforce policy?
- How should the planner step handle API errors or throttling failures explicitly rather than simulating failures?
- What is the recommended approach or CI validation for ensuring planner outputs include properly wrapped `<analysis>` and `<task_description>` tags?
- What is the purpose of the untracked files `bin/claudefsd-interview` and `docs/INTERVIEW-SYSTEM-SUMMARY.md`? Should they be added to the repository or removed?
