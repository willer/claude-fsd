# Questions

- Why was the content of `BRIEF.md` overwritten instead of implementing the static analysis as specified?
- Should the original contents of `docs/PLAN.md` and `BRIEF.md` be restored from version control?
- Is bypassing the content policy with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` intended behavior or should it be removed?
