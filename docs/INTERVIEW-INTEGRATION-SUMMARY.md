# Interview System Integration Summary

## Changes Made to claudefsd

### 1. Updated Menu System
- Added new option 1: "Interactive interview" as the primary requirements gathering method
- Moved old batch questions to option 3 as "legacy"
- Smart default selection based on existing files
- Shows interview session status when present

### 2. Smart File Detection
The system now intelligently determines the default action:
- No BRIEF.md → Create brief (option 0)
- No REQUIREMENTS.md or QUESTIONS.md → Interactive interview (option 1)
- Has REQUIREMENTS.md but no PLAN.md → Create plan from requirements (option 2)
- Has QUESTIONS.md but no PLAN.md → Create plan from questions (option 3)
- Has PLAN.md → Development mode (option 4)

### 3. Command Line Support
Added new command: `claudefsd interview` or `claude-fsd interview`
- Can be run directly from command line
- Supports all the same functionality as menu option

### 4. Backward Compatibility
- Old flow still available as "Batch questions" (option 3)
- Existing QUESTIONS.md files still work with plan creation
- Plan creation automatically detects whether to use REQUIREMENTS.md or QUESTIONS.md

### 5. Unified Plan Creation
- `claudefsd-create-plan` now reads from both QUESTIONS.md and REQUIREMENTS.md
- Automatically uses whatever files are available
- Single script reduces duplication and maintenance
