# Interactive Interview System - Implementation Summary

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Planning and Design
- Created comprehensive implementation plan for converting batch requirements gathering to interactive interview system
- Designed coordinator-driven approach with intelligent persona selection
- Documented detailed architecture in `docs/INTERVIEW-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`

### 2. Persona System
Created persona prompt templates:
- **Project Manager Coordinator** (`prompts/interview_coordinator.txt`) - Intelligently selects next expert
- **Database Administrator** (`prompts/interview_dba_adapted.txt`) - Focuses on data architecture
- **Software Engineer** (`prompts/interview_software_engineer.txt`) - Covers implementation details
- **DevOps Engineer** (`prompts/interview_devops_engineer.txt`) - Handles deployment/operations

Still needed:
- Technical Architect (adapt from existing)
- UX Expert (adapt from existing)
- Security Expert (create new)

### 3. Script Structure
- Created basic structure for `bin/claudefsd-interview` (needs completion)
- Designed session state management with JSON format
- Planned Q&A tracking with persona attribution
- Included save/resume functionality

### 4. Integration Plan
Updated `docs/PLAN.md` with Phase 1 tasks for interview system implementation

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Coordinator-Driven Selection**: A Project Manager persona analyzes progress and selects the most appropriate expert for each question, ensuring comprehensive coverage.

2. **20-Word Question Limit**: Keeps questions focused and answerable in 1-2 sentences.

3. **Session Persistence**: JSON-based session state allows interruption and resumption.

4. **Flexible Completion**: Users can end interview via "done", "exit", or Ctrl-D, or coordinator can suggest when sufficient.

5. **Requirements Consolidation**: Post-interview phase generates comprehensive REQUIREMENTS.md from all Q&A.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the `claudefsd-interview` script implementation
2. Create remaining persona prompts (Technical Architect, UX Expert, Security Expert)
3. Test the interview flow with various project types
4. Integrate with main claudefsd workflow
5. Add comprehensive error handling and edge cases

## Notes

- The BRIEF.md and PLAN.md files were modified during the session (possibly by the FSD system running)
- The original interview system tasks remain in the todo list for tracking
- The prompts directory structure follows the pattern from your coworker's system but adapted for general software projects
