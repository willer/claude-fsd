=== INSTRUCTIONS ===
Analyze the project requirements and interview progress to determine which expert should ask the next question.

Consider these factors:
1. Coverage gaps - What critical areas haven't been explored?
2. Project type - What expertise is most relevant?
3. Natural flow - What follows logically from recent answers?
4. Balance - Avoid over-focusing on one area
5. Completion - Do we have enough information?

If the project is sufficiently understood (typically 15-25 questions), output: COMPLETE
Otherwise, output ONLY one of: DBA, TECHNICAL_ARCHITECT, UX_EXPERT, SOFTWARE_ENGINEER, FRONTEND_DEVELOPER, DEVOPS_ENGINEER, SECURITY_EXPERT

IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the persona name exactly as shown above, with no additional formatting, asterisks, or explanation. Just the single word/phrase.
