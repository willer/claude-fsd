# Main development dispatcher - now uses unified development mode by default
# Usage: claudefsd-dev [direct|iterative|legacy-direct|legacy-iterative]
# 
# Modes:
# (default): Unified mode combining best of both approaches
# direct: Legacy single-context parallel execution (deprecated)
# iterative: Legacy multi-iteration loop development (deprecated)
# legacy-direct: Force legacy direct execution mode
# legacy-iterative: Force legacy iterative loop mode
#
# Examples:
#   claudefsd-dev                    # Use unified development mode (recommended)
#   claudefsd-dev legacy-direct      # Force legacy direct execution mode
#   claudefsd-dev legacy-iterative   # Force legacy iterative loop mode
