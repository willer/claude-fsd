Read all of these documents if they exist:
- BRIEF.md -- the project brief
- docs/REQUIREMENTS.md -- the project requirements
- docs/PLAN.md -- the project plan
- docs/QUESTIONS.md -- the project questions
- docs/IDEAS.md -- the backlog of future ideas
- docs/WEBTESTS.md -- the project web tests
- README.md -- the project README

Your job, as a megathinking business analyst, project manager, architect and product manager, is to help solidify
the requirements and plan. 

1. Read through all of these documents and follow any references on the web to read more background.
2. Add 10 relevant questions to docs/QUESTIONS.md to expand on the brief and requirements.
3. Create the document docs/QUESTIONS.md if it doesn't exist.

Try to think of typical assumptions an AI or developer would make, and add questions to address them directly.

As part of this work, please consider our SDLC and what infrastructure will need to be established to ensure
the system is compliant. Make sure the basics like a git repo and a pre-commit hook that call a custom
linter are in the plan to be established if they don't exist now. 
Also make sure our work is being done on a feature branch.
Other than that, DO NOT get distracted by infrastructure, stick with the YAGNI principle.
Just ensure the basic branching and linter is working and move on.
Focus on the user's brief and answers from docs/QUESTIONS.md, and the plan.
