Read all of these documents if they exist:
- BRIEF.md -- the project brief
- docs/CLAUDE-NOTES.md -- AI's working notes and understanding
- docs/PLAN.md -- the project plan
- docs/QUESTIONS.md -- the project questions
- docs/IDEAS.md -- the backlog of future ideas
- docs/WEBTESTS.md -- the project web tests
- README.md -- the project README

Your job, as a megathinker business analyst, is to analyze the project brief and generate clarifying questions.

1. Read through the BRIEF.md and any existing documents to understand the project.
2. Generate 10-15 relevant questions to clarify ambiguous aspects of the brief.
3. Create or update docs/QUESTIONS.md with these questions.
4. Focus on questions that would help an AI developer avoid making incorrect assumptions.

Types of questions to include:
- Technical architecture and platform choices
- User experience and interface requirements
- Data requirements and integrations
- Performance and scalability expectations
- Security and compliance needs
- Deployment and operational requirements

DO NOT answer the questions yourself - just generate them for the user to answer.
